# TheBallotBreakdownApp

This was the first app I published to the app store. It was approved on June 24, 2021.
The purpose of this app is to provide information about political candidates and their bills/votes to users.
To accomplish this goal, I used several open-source APIs and one paid API in Votesmart.


If you ever decide to update this app, consider adding account features, text detection for ballots, and the candidate information outside of Congress
