# TheBallotBreakdownApp

This was the first app I published to the app store. It was approved on June 24, 2021.
The purpose of this app is to provide information about political candidates and their bills/votes to users.
To accomplish this goal, I used several open-source APIs and one paid API in Votesmart.
